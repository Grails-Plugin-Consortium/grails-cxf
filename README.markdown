** Notice **

Branch 1.0.0 is the upcoming change branch.  Release expected before 9/30.

-------

Unfortunately, I cannot currently support this grails plugin adequately. I am no longer a Grails user, and haven't been for a long time. Due to this, the grails-cxf plugin is basically deprecated. It may still work, but it is not something I can actively push forward.

I originally wrote it for Grails 1.1, but the framework has changed so much since then that it desperately needs some attention (and perhaps a total rewrite). If you would like to take over, please let me (ryan.j.crum@gmail.com) know. I will update this page to point to your canonical repo.
